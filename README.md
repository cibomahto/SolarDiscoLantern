Solar Disco Lantern
===================

A disco twist on the traditional solar lantern, this little guy will light your way at night, and bounce to your music!

An all-analog circuit makes for a low-power and low-cost design.

The solar charging circuit is based on the Kimono Lantern Kit by Akiba:
